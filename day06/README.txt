This programm calculates the proton conductivity of material from experimantal data measured by impedance spectroscopy.
In the input excel file there are several sheets containing following information:
1. Temperature of measurements (in the worksheet title)
2. Hodograph for this temperature represented as a table  
The program finds the minimum value of the complex component of the impedance 
and the corresponding value of the real component of the impedance, which is equal to the resistance of the material.
Then programm calculates the proton conductivity from the resistance using the parameters of the sample (thickness and radius of pellet).
These parameters are customized for each experiment by input.
The output gives values of proton conductivity for each tempersture.
